This project's aim was to predict the customer churn using various machine learning such as Random Forest CLassifier, Logistic Regression, KNN, decision Tree classifier and Gradient Boosting CLassifier.

# **Libraries**
- Pandas
* Numpy
+ Scikit-Learn
- Seaborn
* Matplotlib
  
# **Steps**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data PreProcessing :
   - Removing independent columns
   - Handling missing values and removing outliers
   - One Hot encoding for categorical data
   - Dividing the dataste into train and test dataset
3. Model Evaluation

# **Results**
The Gradient Boosting Classifier performs the best with a 49.86% accuracy. Precision, Recall, F1 score metrics showed better with Gradient Boost Classifier.
